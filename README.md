# ColourGame-Python

Basically I made this project for learning purpose. The project is like mind game. And the project is designed such that you have to focus on this only. Because In this game, one colour name display in the screen and you have to write that the colour name is in which colour. You have some fix amount of time to play this and score board is also there.
